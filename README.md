# BFSI Call Center AI Assistant

📌 Project Overview

The BFSI Call Center AI Assistant is a lightweight, compliant AI system designed to handle common customer queries in the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) domain.

Use cases:
1. Semantic Retrieval (Sentence Transformers)
2. Policy-Grounded RAG Architecture
3. Local Small Language Model (SLM) via Ollama
4. Controlled Prompt Engineering
5. Threshold-Based Fallback Logic

The assistant supports queries related to:
1. Loan eligibility and application status
2. EMI details and schedules
3. Interest rate information
4. Payment and transaction queries
5. Basic account support

📌 System Architecture



📌 Core Components

1️⃣ Dataset Layer (Primary Response Layer)
1. 150+ BFSI conversation samples
2. Alpaca format (Instruction, Input, Output)
3. Professional and compliant tone
4. Embedded using all-mpnet-base-v2

Role:
If cosine similarity score exceeds threshold →
Return stored response directly.
This ensures:
1. Deterministic answers
2. Zero hallucination
3. Policy-safe responses

2️⃣ Small Language Model (Local SLM)
1. Lightweight instruction-based model
2. Runs locally via Ollama
3. Model: phi3:mini

Role:
Used only when:
No strong dataset similarity match is found
This provides flexibility while maintaining safety.

3️⃣ RAG Layer (Knowledge Retrieval)
Used for complex financial or policy-related queries such as:
1. Interest rate explanations
2. EMI breakdowns
3. Prepayment penalties
4. Foreclosure policies

Implementation:
1. Structured knowledge base (knowledge_base.json)
2. Embedded into vectors
3. Retrieved via cosine similarity
4. Injected into controlled prompt

Role:
Provide grounded, policy-based responses.

📌 Response Priority Logic

Tier 1 -- Strong dataset similarity	Return stored response

Tier 2 -- Complex financial query -- Use RAG retrieval

Tier 3 -- Generate via local SLM

This ensures a safety-first design.

📌 Guardrails & Compliance

The assistant enforces strict BFSI safety rules:
1. No guessing financial numbers
2. No fake interest rates
3. No fabricated policies
4. No exposure of customer-specific data
5. Reject out-of-domain queries

Low-temperature generation (0.3) is used to reduce randomness.
